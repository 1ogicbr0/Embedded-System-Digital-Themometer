# Embedded-System-Digital-Themometer
Digital Themometer for measuring Thermistor + using push buttons.
> An Electrical Engineering Project :).
We were supposed to read thermistor display reading on thermometer. 
# Components:
  * MCU (pic16f882)
  * LCD (LM016L)
  * Thermistor (NTC)
  * Resistors
  * 5V battery
  * Push buttons
> A project file of proteus is also given, you can simulate it using that file
